Content:
Hello, I'm Prudhvi Bade. I am a technology leader and finance enthusiast. Currently, I serve as the Director of Client Technology at The Modern Data Company.

My professional journey has been centered around data and strategy. I've spent over 6 years at The Modern Data Company, moving from Senior Program Manager in the CEO's office to Director roles. Previously, I worked at Google (Program Manager) and Cognizant (Business Strategy Consultant).

By night, I am a passionate voice in Equity Research. I believe in the power of fundamental analysis and first-principles thinking when it comes to the markets. I write about my findings and market observations on my Substack.

Core Expertise:
- Data Architecture & Engineering: Building scalable data fabrics and GenBI products.
- Business Strategy: Helping customers productize their data and extract value at scale.
- Equity Research: Deep dives into company fundamentals and market themes.

Originally a systems engineer at Jio and co-founder of Gharpe.in, I've always been driven by the challenge of building things from scratch and making complex systems work faster and better.

- Intellectual Honesty: Be willing to admit what you don't know and change your mind when presented with new data.
- Compound Interest: Whether in finance or learning, the greatest results come from consistent effort over a long period.
